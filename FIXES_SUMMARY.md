## Text Overlap and Menu Fixes - Summary

### Issues Fixed:

#### 1. **Text Overlap Issue**
- **Problem**: Content was overlapping with the bottom menu in all screens
- **Solution**: Added proper bottom padding (140px) to all screen layouts:
  - `characteristics.py`: Changed padding from `[30, 40, 30, 20]` to `[30, 40, 30, 140]`
  - `rolls.py`: Changed padding from `[30, 40, 30, 20]` to `[30, 40, 30, 140]`
  - `ability_checks.py`: Changed padding from `[30, 40, 30, 20]` to `[30, 40, 30, 140]`
  - `combat.py`: Changed padding from `[30, 40, 30, 20]` to `[30, 40, 30, 140]`
  - `settings.py`: Changed padding from `[30, 40, 30, 20]` to `[30, 40, 30, 140]`

#### 2. **Bottom Menu Optimization**
- **Reduced menu height**: From 120px to 100px
- **Reduced button height**: From 80px to 70px  
- **Reduced font sizes**: Icon from 16 to 14, text from 11 to 10
- **Reduced padding and spacing**: Better utilization of space

#### 3. **First Menu Issue**
- **Problem**: App opened with fancy welcome screen that user didn't like
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed default screen from `'menu'` to `'characteristics'`
  - Created alternative simple menu (`simple_menu.py`) with clean design
  - Added "Menú" button to bottom menu for easy access to simple menu
  - Replaced "Chequeos" button with "Menú" button in bottom navigation

### New Features:

#### **Simple Menu Screen** (`screens/simple_menu.py`)
- Clean, minimal design with simple grid layout
- Direct access to all main functions
- No fancy animations or complex styling

### Menu Structure Changes:

#### **Bottom Menu Navigation**:
- **MENU** → Simple Menu
- **DICE** → Dados (Rolls)
- **CHAR** → Personaje (Characteristics) 
- **FIGHT** → Combate (Combat)
- **GEAR** → Ajustes (Settings)

#### **App Startup**:
- Now starts directly in **Characteristics** screen
- User can access Simple Menu via bottom menu "MENU" button
- Original fancy menu still available via screen manager

### Technical Improvements:

1. **Better spacing**: All content now has proper clearance from bottom menu
2. **Responsive design**: Content areas use proper scrolling with adequate padding
3. **Menu accessibility**: Multiple menu options available for different user preferences
4. **Code organization**: Added new simple menu screen without breaking existing functionality
