# Button Display Fix - README

## Problem Solved
The buttons in the Daggerheart Tracker app were appearing "off" or not displaying correctly on PC. This was due to several issues:

1. **Canvas Drawing Issues**: The original implementation had problems with background rectangle updates
2. **Emoji Compatibility**: Emoji icons don't render consistently across all Windows systems
3. **Layout Timing**: Canvas elements were being drawn before widgets were properly sized
4. **Animation Conflicts**: Complex animations were interfering with button display

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Adaptive Button System
Created an adaptive button system that automatically detects your platform and uses the most compatible display method:

- **Windows**: Uses text-based icons (DICE, CHECK, CHAR, FIGHT, GEAR) for maximum compatibility
- **Mac/Linux**: Can use emoji icons where supported
- **Auto-detection**: Platform detection happens automatically

### 2. Improved Canvas Management
- Background rectangles are now properly redrawn when widgets resize
- Canvas updates are scheduled using Clock.schedule_once for proper timing
- Eliminated canvas update conflicts

### 3. Better Button Layout
- Removed complex animations that could cause display issues
- Improved text sizing and positioning
- Added proper size hints for consistent button distribution

### 4. Platform Configuration
Created a platform configuration system that:
- Detects system type automatically
- Provides optimal button configurations per platform
- Allows easy customization if needed

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `components/platform_config.py` - Platform detection and configuration
- `components/bottom_menu_adaptive.py` - Adaptive button implementation
- `components/bottom_menu_pc.py` - PC-specific implementation
- Test files for verification

### Modified Files:
- `main.py` - Adjusted window size constraints
- All screen files (`screens/*.py`) - Updated to use adaptive menu
- `components/bottom_menu.py` - Fixed original implementation

## Testing
The solution has been tested and verified to work correctly:
- Buttons display properly on Windows PC
- Button clicks are registered and work correctly
- Screen navigation functions as expected
- No console errors or warnings

## Usage
The app now automatically uses the best button implementation for your system. No configuration needed - just run the app normally:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Future Compatibility
The adaptive system makes it easy to add support for:
- Different icon sets
- Custom themes
- Accessibility options
- Touch-specific optimizations

## Verification
Run the test script to verify everything works:

```bash
python test_adaptive_buttons.py
```

This will show your system info and let you test all button functionality.
